## Iterator

### What's iterator_traits ?

std::iterator_traits is a template class in the C++ Standard Template Library (STL) that allows you to obtain information about an iterator, such as its value type, difference type, and pointer type. It can be used to write generic algorithms that work with a wide range of iterator types, including both built-in and user-defined iterators. The class provides a uniform way of accessing information about an iterator, regardless of the underlying container or data structure.
